# MovieRecommendation
A recommendation system is a type of information filtering system which attempts to predict the preferences of a user, and make suggests based on these preferences. There are a wide variety of applications for recommendation systems. These have become increasingly popular over the last few years and are now utilized in most online platforms that we use. The content of such platforms varies from movies, music, books and videos, to friends and stories on social media platforms, to products on e-commerce websites, to people on professional and dating websites, to search results returned on Google.

Every user has different preferences and likes. In addition, even the taste of a single user can vary depending on a large number of factors, such as mood, season, or type of activity the user is doing. For example, the type of music one would like to hear while exercising differs greatly from the type of music heâ€™d listen to when cooking dinner. Another issue that recommendation systems have to solve is the exploration vs exploitation problem. They must explore new domains to discover more about the user, while still making the most of what is already known about of the user. Two main approaches are widely used for recommender systems. One is content-based filtering, where we try to profile the users interests using information collected, and recommend items based on that profile. The other is collaborative filtering, where we try to group similar users together and use information about the group to make recommendations to the user.

Here I'm going to build up the recommendation program using Matrix Factorization technique.
